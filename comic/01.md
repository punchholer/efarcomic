# Front matter data in 11ty is incredibly flexible, with authors free to define
# new variables to refernce in templates on the fly. Make sure to adhere to
# YAML's formatting guidelines! (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/)

title: The First Page Title     # Title of the page
images: ['/img/comics/pg1.jpg'] # Location of the comic panel(s)
alt: Here's some alt text!      # Descriptive text for the panel(s)
thumb: '/img/thumbs/pg1.png'    # Location of the thumbnail
tags:                           # Collection for the page
  - chapter1

# Here are a few other things to consider when adding in front matter:
# - If no title is given, it will be given one based on its filename
# - Dates are automatically set for you to when the file was first created

If you want to write an author notes section, this'd be the place to do it. You can even use whatever HTML tags you want in here, or you can use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to format it.
